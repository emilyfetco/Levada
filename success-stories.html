            <h3>Bill Gates' First Business Was a Failure</h3>
            <p>Even Bill Gates, once the richest person in the world, struggled initially. His first venture, Traf-O-Data, aimed to process traffic data using a specialized device. However, the product flopped—it didn’t even work during their pitch to potential buyers. Despite this setback, Gates and his partner, Paul Allen, persevered. Reflecting on the experience, Allen noted, "Even though Traf-O-Data wasn’t a roaring success, it was seminal in preparing us to make Microsoft’s first product a couple of years later."</p>

            <h3>Albert Einstein Didn’t Speak Until He Was Four</h3>

Even in school, his teachers thought he was lazy, despite his good grades, because he was often lost in abstract thoughts. Those daydreams, however, eventually led him to develop the groundbreaking theory of relativity—concepts that continue to challenge our understanding today.</p>

            <h3>Thomas Edison Failed Thousands of Times Before Succeeding</h3>
            <p>Thomas Edison’s journey to inventing the lightbulb was marked by repeated failures—reportedly between 1,000 and 10,000 attempts.
